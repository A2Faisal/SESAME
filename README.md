# SESAME Project

## About
Data on human and non-human systems are typically archived in very different ways, in different places. The SESAME project aims to bring key human-Earth datasets into the same, spatially-gridded format to accelerate discovery and aid modeling efforts.

## Documentation
[Link to readthedocs.io]

## Installation Instructions
### If you want to use conda to manage your  environment
conda create -n sesame_env

conda activate sesame_env

conda install pip

pip install sesame

### Then at the top of your python script,
import opensesame as sm


## Goals
- Bring human and non-human system datasets into a unified spatially-gridded format.
- Accelerate data discovery and facilitate modeling efforts through standardized data structures.
- Foster interdisciplinary collaboration and research by providing accessible and integrated datasets.

## Software Package
SESAME Software package is dependent on multiple python files. Users are requested to download the files from src folder. Software documentation will be available soon.

## Human-Earth Atlas
Datasets can be downloaded in NetCDF format from {link}. Detailed dataset documentation file can be found in [Google Spreadsheet].
