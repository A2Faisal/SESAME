# 🌱 SESAME Project

## 🌍 About

The **SESAME project** aims to unify key human and non-human (Earth system) datasets into a shared spatially-gridded format. These datasets are often siloed in incompatible formats; SESAME bridges that gap to accelerate scientific discovery and interdisciplinary modeling.

## 🎯 Goals

- Unify human and non-human system datasets in a standardized spatially-gridded structure.
- Improve data discoverability and interoperability for research and modeling.
- Support interdisciplinary science through accessible, integrated datasets.

## 🛠️ Example Tools

- **`point_2_grid`**  
  Maps point data onto standardized global grids. Supports counting points per cell, summing or averaging associated values, or grouping by class to generate multi-variable datasets.

- **`line_2_grid`**  
  Maps line data onto global grids by calculating the length of each line segment within grid cells. Supports aggregation methods such as mean, max, or standard deviation through spatial intersections.

- **`poly_2_grid`**  
  Handles polygon data by computing the fraction or area of each polygon that overlaps with each grid cell. Supports combining multiple polygon types into a multi-variable NetCDF output.

- **`grid_2_grid`**  
  Converts raster data to a new grid resolution. Ensures global coverage, checks projections, fills in missing cells with NaNs, and supports aggregation methods like sum, mean, max, min, or standard deviation.

- **`table_2_grid`**  
  Converts jurisdiction-level tabular data into standardized grids using surrogate variables. Accounts for boundary changes over time for accurate spatial representation.

- **`add_iso3_column`**  
  Standardizes country names by converting them to ISO3 codes. This function is a prerequisite for running `table_2_grid`.

- **`grid_2_table`**  
  Reverses the gridding process by aggregating gridded data into summary tables based on predefined regions or countries.

- **Built-in plotting functions**  
  SESAME also includes tools for quick visualization and mapping, such as `plot_histogram`, `plot_scatter`, `plot_time_series`, and `plot_hexbin` for charts, and `plot_map`, `plot_country` for gridded or choropleth maps. These functions help generate both exploratory plots and publication-ready outputs with minimal setup.

## ⚙️ Installation Instructions

If you're using **conda** to manage your Python environment:

### Step 1: Create and activate the environment

```bash
# create a new conda environment
conda create -n sesame_env
# activate the environment
conda activate sesame_env
# install pip
conda install pip
# install SESAME from testPyPI
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple sesame==0.1.0
```
### Step 2: Add this as a Python code snippet:
```bash
import sesame as ssm 
```

### If you are using Windows and encounter the error: 
“ERROR: Failed building wheel for cartopy,” please follow these steps:

1. Download and install the Microsoft C++ Build Tools from the official website:  
   [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)

2. During installation, make sure to select the **"Desktop development with C++"** workload.  
   This is required to build packages like cartopy that depend on C++ extensions.

## 🧪 Testing SESAME

To verify the functionality of the SESAME toolbox, a Jupyter notebook is provided:

📓 [Test Notebook: `test/test_sesametoolbox.ipynb`](https://github.com/A2Faisal/SESAME/blob/main/test/test_sesametoolbox.ipynb)

This notebook demonstrates core features using sample datasets located in:

📁 [Test Data: `test/data/`](https://github.com/A2Faisal/SESAME/tree/main/test/data)

### 📌 To run the test:

1. Make sure your environment is activated:
    ```bash
    conda activate sesame_env
    ```

2. Install Jupyter (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    conda install jupyter
    ```

3. Launch the notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook test/test_sesametoolbox.ipynb
    ```

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run sample tests.

> 🔍 **Note:** Ensure that all paths in the notebook refer to `test/data/` correctly. The folder structure must be preserved when cloning or downloading the repository.
