# SESAME Project

## About
Data on human and non-human systems are typically archived in very different ways, in different places. The SESAME project aims to bring key human-Earth datasets into the same, spatially-gridded format to accelerate discovery and aid modeling efforts.

## Goals
- Bring human and non-human system datasets into a unified spatially-gridded format.
- Accelerate data discovery and facilitate modeling efforts through standardized data structures.
- Foster interdisciplinary collaboration and research by providing accessible and integrated datasets.

## Software Package
SESAME Software package is dependent on some large files. Users are requested to download the files from {link}. Software documentation can also be accessed from {here}. 

## Human-Earth Atlas
Datasets can be downloaded in NetCDF format from {link}. Detailed dataset documentation file can be found in [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17rn570hyfLm0OsSmbTxHcVGPS4Vy27EpWAI02Rqu-WQ/edit?usp=sharing).
