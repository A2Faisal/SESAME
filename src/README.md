# SESAME Project


## About
Data on human and non-human systems are typically archived in very different ways, in different places. The SESAME project aims to bring key human-Earth datasets into the same, spatially-gridded format to accelerate discovery and aid modeling efforts.

## Goals
- Bring human and non-human system datasets into a unified spatially-gridded format.
- Accelerate data discovery and facilitate modeling efforts through standardized data structures.
- Foster interdisciplinary collaboration and research by providing accessible and integrated datasets.
